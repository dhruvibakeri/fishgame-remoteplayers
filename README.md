### How To Test

For the controller, run the following in the `Controller` directory:

```
scl enable rh-nodejs10 bash
make
npm test
```

For the view, run the following in the `View` directory:

```
scl enable rh-nodejs10 bash
make
npm run serve
```

and open browser at `localhost:8080`,
or test using

```
npm run test:unit
```

NOTE: If you're having issues installing npm packages on khoury machines, try clearing the cache using `npm cache clean` and installing again.
We attempted to make a makefile in the Common directory that installed packages for both Controller and Views, but ran into issues with exceeding stack size on khoury machines. You may have success with these files, but if not please follow the instructions above to install dependencies and run visualization/tests separately so as to not overwhelm the capabilities of the vm. The `Makefile`, `view-run` `view-test` and `controller-test` files work on non-vm.

# 1 &mdash; Dot Game

These additions are for the assignment, [1 - Dot Game](https://felleisen.org/matthias/4500-f20/1.html). The `Fish` directory is intended to hold all future work done on the Fish tournament game project, including both planning and implementation. The purpose of this assignment is to create our first two memos for planning out this whole project.

It contains the following elements:

- `Planning` : Directory containing all planning documents for the Fish project
  - `system.pdf` : Memo containing a high level description of our Fish project's software components
  - `milestones.pdf` : Memo describing our plan for splitting this project into milestones and deliverables

# E

This directory is for the assignment, [E — TCP](https://felleisen.org/matthias/4500-f20/E.html). The purpose of this assignment was to be an exercise in our chosen programming language, [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and in collaborating on and delivering software. This assignment sets up a TCP connection which takes in well-formed JSON from the input and delivers JSON to output side of TCP connection.

It contains the following elements:

- `Makefile` : Used to handle basic environment setup for a Node environment compatible with Khoury's machines along with Typescript compilation.
- `xtcp` : The shell-executable command-line program specified within the assignment prompt.
- `Test` : Directory containing test files.
- `Other` : Directory containing all auxiliary files.
  - `src` : Directory containing all TypeScript files for the project
    - `parse.ts` : TypeScript file with helper functions for parsing json sequence
    - `utils.ts` : TypeScript file with utils for validating command line arguments
    - `xjson.ts` : TypeScript file with helper functions for reading and formatting output of json
    - `xtcp.ts` : Script which sets up and manages the server
  - `package.json` : Node generated file for handling project information and dependencies.
  - `tsconfig.json` : Configuration file for Typescript
  - `.eslintrc` : Configuration file for eslint

### How To Run On Khoury Machines

Run these commands within the `D` directory:

```
scl enable rh-nodejs10 bash
make
./xtcp [TCP port number] // Run with hexagon size
```

# D

This directory is for the assignment, [D — GUI](https://felleisen.org/matthias/4500-f20/D.html). The purpose of this assignment was to be an exercise in our chosen programming language, [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and in collaborating on and delivering software.

It contains the following elements:

- `Makefile` : Used to handle basic environment setup for a Node environment compatible with Khoury's machines along with Typescript compilation.
- `xgui` : The shell-executable command-line program specified within the assignment prompt.
- `Test` : Directory containing test files.
- `Other` : Directory containing all auxiliary files.
  - `src` : Directory containing all TypeScript files for the project
    - `App.ts` : TypeScript file which, when run, starts a node Expressjs server
    - `closeWindow` : Script to close the view window when the hexagon is clicked
  - `views` : Directory containing the 'view' (HTML) portion of our app
    - `hexagonView.pug` : pug (templated HTML) file containing the hexagon view
  - `package-lock.json` : Node generated file for specifying exact versions of Node packages.
  - `package.json` : Node generated file for handling project information and dependencies.
  - `tsconfig.json` : Configuration file for Typescript
  - `.eslintrc` : Configuration file for eslint

### How To Run On Khoury Machines

Run these commands within the `D` directory:

```
scl enable rh-nodejs10 bash
make
./xgui [positive-integer] // Run with hexagon size
```

### How To Test

After making the project, run `./test` within the `D` directory.

`xgui` takes in a positive integer representing the size for a rendered hexagon, and opens a window to display the hexagon at the given size

- When the user clicks the hexagon, the window closes and the program stops
- If a user doesn't enter a postive integer with the `./xgui` command, the program will print the usage message

# C

This directory is for the assignment, [C — JSON](https://felleisen.org/matthias/4500-f20/C.html). The purpose of this assignment was to be an exercise in our chosen programming language, [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and in collaborating on and delivering software.

It contains the following elements:

- `Makefile` : Used to handle basic environment setup for a Node environment compatible with Khoury's machines along with Typescript compilation.
- `xjson` : The shell-executable command-line program specified within the assignment prompt.
- `Test` : Directory containing test files.
  - `1-in.json` : input for testing the `xjson` program
  - `1-out.json` : expected output generated when running `xjson` with `1-in.json`
- `Other` : Directory containing all auxiliary files.
  - `package-lock.json` : Node generated file for specifying exact versions of Node packages.
  - `package.json` : Node generated file for handling project information and dependencies.
  - `tsconfig.json` : Configuration file for Typescript
  - `xjson.ts` : Typescript implementation for the prompt program.

### How To Run On Khoury Machines

Run these commands within the `C` directory:

```
scl enable rh-nodejs10 bash
make
chmod +x xjson
./xjson < [JSON file] // Run with input file
echo '[sequence of JSON values]' | ./xjson // Run with text input from command line
```

`xjson` takes in a sequence of well-formatted JSON values from STDIN, parses them, and outputs them in the following two outputs to STDOUT:

- First, a JSON object with two fields, `count` which represents the number of JSON values entered in the input sequence, and `seq`, a list of all JSON values entered in the order they were entered.
- Second, a JSON list in which the first element represents the count of JSON values entered, and the remaining elements are the JSON values in reverse order.

### Design Decisions

To parse the JSON input, we used the `JSON.parse()` function that is included in the latest Javascript standard. While this function is the standard for parsing JSON in Javascript, it is somewhat limited in that it can only parse a single JSON value. Because JSON.parse() is so widely used, there aren't many well-supported JSON libraries for Javascript which is why we decided to use this function despite its limit.

We decided not to use a library to tokenize the string input before parsing using `JSON.parse()` because the ones we found had little, if any, documentation and did not handle edge cases well. We decided it was not a good design decision to use a library that is not reliable and not well-supported. For this reason, we implemented our own method of separating the input string into valid JSON values before parsing.

# B

This directory is for the assignment, [B — Command Line](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/4500-f20/B.html). The purpose of this assignment was to be an exercise in our chosen programming language, [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and in collaborating on and delivering software.

It contains the following elements:

- `Makefile` : Used to handle basic environment setup for a Node environment compatible with Khoury's machines along with Typescript compilation.
- `xyes` : The shell-executable command-line program specified within the assignment prompt.
- `Other` : Directory containing all auxiliary files.
  - `package-lock.json` : Node generated file for specifying exact versions of Node packages.
  - `package.json` : Node generated file for handling project information and dependencies.
  - `tsconfig.json` : Configuration file for Typescript
  - `xyes.ts` : Typescript implementation for the prompt program.

### How To Run On Khoury Machines

Run these commands within the `B` directory:

```
scl enable rh-nodejs10 bash
make
chmod +x xyes
./xyes [-limit] [args ...]
```

`xyes` behaves similarly to the Unix `yes` command in that it infinitely echoes text to standard output. However, the user may define what string to echo via command line argument and specify whether to limit the output.

If no output string is specified, the program defaults to outputting `hello world`.

Additionally, if the first command line argument given is the `-limit` flag, then the program will limit its output to only 20 lines of the output string.
