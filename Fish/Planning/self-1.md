## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 1

### General

We will run self-evaluations for each milestone this semester. The
graders will evaluate them for accuracy and completeness.

Every self-evaluation will go out into your Enterprise GitHub repo
within a short time afrer the milestone deadline, and you will have 24
hours to answer the questions and push back a completed form.

This one is a practice run to make sure you get

### Specifics

- does your analysis cover the following ideas:

  - the need for an explicit Interface specification between the (remote) AI
    players and the game system?

    - Yes, within `system.pdf` within sections 3 and 4 ("In terms of exposed APIs...," "There should also be a _play API_...").

  - the need for a referee sub-system for managing individual games

    - Yes, within `system.pdf` within section 1, bullet point 3 ("Houses and makes calls...").

  - the need for a tournament management sub-system for grouping
    players into games and dispatching to referee components

    - Yes, within `system.pdf` within section 1 ("There is a _tournament manager_").

- does your building plan identify concrete milestones with demo prototypes:

  - for running individual games

    - Yes, at the end of the first paragraph we state that the first milestone should include the ability to run an individual game on a local computer

  - for running complete tournaments on a single computer

    - Yes, the bulleted list underneath the first paragraph states that part of the first milestone will be creating a tournament manager to handle local tournaments.

  - for running remote tournaments on a network
    - Yes, the second paragraph discusses elements required to play tournaments on a network in the second milestone.

- for the English of your memo, you may wish to check the following:

  - is each paragraph dedicated to a single topic? does it come with a
    thesis statement that specifies the topic?

    - Yes, each paragraph in the `milestones` document is dedicated to a single topic and has a thesis statement. We used mostly bullet points for the `system` document, but each bullet point relates to the specified topic.

  - do sentences make a point? do they run on?

    - We have a couple of long sentences because we are trying to explain complex software systems. Otherwise sentences/bullets make a point.

  - do sentences connect via old words/new words so that readers keep
    reading?

    - Yes, we use transition words and sentences to keep the reader engaged.

  - are all sentences complete? Are they missing verbs? Objects? Other
    essential words?

    - Sentences are complete.

  - did you make sure that the spelling is correct? ("It's" is _not_ a
    possesive; it's short for "it is". "There" is different from
    "their", a word that is too popular for your generation.)

    - Yes.

The ideal feedback are pointers to specific senetences in your memo.
For PDF, the paragraph/sentence number suffices.

For **code repos**, we will expect GitHub line-specific links.
